This repository contains [veewee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee)
definitions that I use for building vagrant baseboxes for testing
Chef. The contents are generated by the various templates in veewee,
and modified by me for my purposes. They may or may not be suitable
for you.

Thank you, Patrick Debois for creating Veewee.
